# These directives constrain all aspects of the mapspace *except* all the
# ways for data-spaces to bypass storage levels. Timeloop assumes that
# all data-spaces originate in the last-level storage and therefore must
# reside there. However, all options are open for the other 2 storage
# levels in this example. since there are 3 data-spaces, the total number
# of choices = 2^(2*3) = 64, which is the size of the mapspace.
