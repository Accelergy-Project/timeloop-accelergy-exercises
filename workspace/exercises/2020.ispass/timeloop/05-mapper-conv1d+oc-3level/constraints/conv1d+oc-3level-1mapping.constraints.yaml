# These directives completely constrain every single aspect of the mapspace,
# thereby reducing the space down to single degenerate mapping. Running the
# mapper with these constraints will produce the same result as running
# the model directly on that degenerate mapping (which is coincidentally
# specified in a similar syntax).
